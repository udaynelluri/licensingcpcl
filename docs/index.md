## Getting started

Start write your documentation by adding more markdown (.md) files to this folder (/docs) or replace the content in this file.

## Table of Contents

The Table of Contents on the right is generated automatically based on the hierarchy
of headings. Only use one H1 (`#` in Markdown) per file.

## Support

That's it. If you need support, reach out in [#docs-like-code](https://discord.com/channels/687207715902193673/714754240933003266) on Discord.
